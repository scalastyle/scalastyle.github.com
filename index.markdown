title: "Scalastyle - Scala style checker"
---

Scalastyle examines your Scala code and indicates potential problems with it. If you have come across Checkstyle for Java,
then you'll have a good idea what scalastyle is. Except that it's for Scala obviously.

Scalastyle is used as part of the grading framework for the course [Functional Programming Principles in Scala by Martin Odersky](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) on Coursera.

### How do I use scalastyle?

The latest stable version of Scalastyle is 1.0.0 for Scala 2.10/2.11/2.12. See the [Release Notes](release-notes.html)

There are several ways of using it:

 * [Maven Plugin](maven.html)
 * [Eclipse plugin (for 4.2 Juno and 4.3 Kepler and 4.4 Luna)](eclipse-index.html)
 * [SBT plugin](sbt.html)
 * [Command line](command-line.html)
 * [Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/ngbinh/gradle-scalastyle-plugin)
 * Intellij - You can enable scalastyle in Intellij by selecting Settings->Editor->Inspections, then searching for Scala style inspections.
 * [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) - You get out-of-the-box analysis on your git repositories.
 * [CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io) - You get out-of-the-box analysis on your git repositories.
 * [Git pre-commit hook](git-pre-commit-hook.html)

And you'll need a [configuration](configuration.html). If you have your own custom rules, then see [custom rules](custom-rules.html)

For the list of possible rules, see [Implemented Rules](rules-1.0.0.html).
